7. Geranium: 

    Mystery, Ingenuity, Nonchalance

    Geraniums grow in tight groups, and similarly, you like to stick to a small, close-knit group of acquaintances. The people closest to you will see the sensitive and clever sides of your personality, but to everyone else, you're a mystery.

10. Pansy

    Tenacity, Contemplation, Thoughtfulness

    Coming from a French word meaning "to think," pansies inspire reflection and contemplation. Likewise, you prefer thorough planning over jumping headfirst into a situation. You are ambitious and practical, which aids you in many facets of life.

11. Carnation

    Fascination, Remembrance, Stability

    Selflessness, Refinement, Uniqueness

    You don't like to stand out in a crowd. You seem reserved unless surrounded by the people you trust. You stay true to who you are and don't conform to fit the social norm.
